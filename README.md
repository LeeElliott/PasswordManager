## 1.0 Overview
An Android application developed in Unity for the sole purpose of storing encrypted password information on the users device.

## 2.0 Features

### 2.1 Database Storage
This application makes use of the SQLite framework for the storage of password information. The user, however, is only provided with a limited GUI.
This should help to prevent serious problems arising through user error.

### 2.2 Encryption
At present, a simple, multi-layer substitution is employed using an encryption key, which is different fo each and every piece of data being stored.
This algorythm may be altered in future updates.

### 2.3 Dummy Screen
As an added layer of protection, the user is first presented with a screen which they must know how to navigate in order to access the password 
application. This is not overly complicated, the user has but to click on the fake advert banner at the bottom edge of the screen.
